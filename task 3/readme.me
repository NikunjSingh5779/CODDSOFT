 Task 3: Movie Recommendation System
This is Task 3 of my CodSoft Internship (Batch B42) â€” a content-based movie recommendation system that suggests movies similar to the one you search for, based on their descriptions.

 Features
Content-based filtering using TF-IDF Vectorization
Cosine Similarity to find the most similar movies
CSV dataset containing movie titles and descriptions

Two modes of running:
Google Colab Notebook (Movie_Recommendation.ipynb)


 Tech Stack
Python 
Pandas (Data Handling)
Scikit-learn (TF-IDF & Cosine Similarity)
Google Colab (for quick execution)

 How it works
 copy the code from recommendation.ipynb
 paste it on Colab
